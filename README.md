# PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
The COVID-19 (coronavirus) is inciting panic for a number of reasons. It is highly contagious. The COVID-19 pandemic has been felt across all industries, sparing little and forever changing the way we live, socialize, and work. Over days,months, years and still counting, there are reports of people confirmed to be infected and dead as a result of the outbreak.

# DATA TRANSFORMATION:
I got the data from the source. Through web scraping upload it in the Microsoft Excel. It is then transformed into power query editor from where The further process of changing first row to header, renaming the columns, merging the seperate querries (confirmed cases, death cases and recovered cases) into one query. Then after corrrecting the data type of every column, just load the data to Excel.

After loading the data in Excel, I just extraxt the year, month amd day from the date column to seperate column for further analysis.

...
Based on the data, many pivot tables are made for the better understanding of the data. From this analysis we have come to know about the country wuth hish and low previlance of COVIS_19 cases. Also the death rate over worldwide.

# DATA VISUALIZATION:
The dashboard is made in Excel for the graphical representation of the  COVID_19 Global Time Series Data to help better understanding of the spreadness of the disease and rate of the death. In order to take the preventive measures against this infectious disease.
